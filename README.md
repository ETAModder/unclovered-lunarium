# Unclovered Lunarium

_A lightweight approach to removing Clover's services dependency_

<img src="lunarium.PNG" align="center" />

Important note: this is **NOT A REAL HACKING TOOLKIT**! This has been made, works and will work only in the game called Grey Hack!

## Objectives

Unclovered Lunarium aims to make Clover's Lunar accessible to everyone without any potential or actual risks for the user
and tries to bring better user experience with less bugs occuring and more commands available

## What has changed comparing to original Lunar?

There is a list of things that are changed so far:

-   Removed intruder detection system(also known as "fstab" rshell)
-   Removed hardcoded apt repository
-   Lunarium launches in local mode ONLY. You can still use all of the CLI flags, though
-   Removed all commands that are relying on servers to work
-   Did some rebranding and applied more neutral theme
-   Fixed some of the original Lunar's bugs
-   Added some useful commands

## Known Bugs

-   May occur frequently now as I am no more working alone on the code and can't test everything
-   You tell me!

## Installation Guide

-   Download the sources from [here](https://github.com/h4cktoria/unclovered-lunarium/tree/main/src) and get them into the game
-   Move **foxlib.src**, **lunariumcmd.src** and **lunarium.src** into your **/root/Scripts** folder
